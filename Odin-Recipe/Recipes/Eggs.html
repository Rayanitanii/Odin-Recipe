 <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>   
 <p>For about five minutes on low heat,
shimmer the oil in a medium non-stick skillet.
Repeat with the second egg,
adding it to the opposite side of the skillet.
Cover with a tight lid and cook,
uninterrupted, until the whites are completely set,
but the yolks are still runny, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.
Remove the eggs from the skillet and place them on toast or a dish.
Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
